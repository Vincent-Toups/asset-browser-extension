* User Stories For Advanced Asset Browsing

We would like to extend the asset browser to do some meta-data based
search. Implementation details aside, the user stories should be
something like this:

** User Wants all (Columnar) Data with A Given Column

The user wishes to search for any data set which contains a given
column, for concreteness, say this column is called "QSSCAT".

The asset browser now contains an additional text field hinted with
"query."

[[./new-search-box.png]]

The user types ~columns :has QSSCAT~ and when the search completes any
columnar data with such a column is returned.  In an ideal world the
first and third part of the above query would be auto-completed from a
list of known columns.

** User Wants all Columnar Data with a given value in a given column

In this slightly more complex case the user wishes to find all
columnar data with both a given column and a given value in that
column.

They enter a query like ~columns :has QSSCAT :and QSSCAT :has "PROMIS
Sleep Disturbance"~

[[./query2.png]]

The result set contains only data sets which have that column and in
which that column contains the value expected.

** User Wants data with at least one column

They enter ~columns :has QSSCAT :or ~columns :has QSSTRESC~

[[./query3.png]]

The results are those data sets with either column.

** User wants data with at least one column but doesn't want to type as much

The user types ~columns :has QSSCAT :or QSSTRESC~ which has the same
result as above.

These minimal features are sufficient to form complex queries over the
meta-data data-model described in the "Data Model" document.
