* Base Query Language

  This document describes a simple query language over the meta-data.

** Terms

   A <symbol> is a set of alphanumeric characters.

   #+begin_src
[a-ZA-Z0-9_-]+
#+end_src

   A <string> is a set of characters enclosed in quotation marks (with
   ordinary escapes required for enclosed quotation marks.

   OR a <string> is a non-quoted series of characters excluding
   whitespace.

   A logical operator is either:

   ~:or~ or ~:and~

   A <has> is just literally ~:has~ and will be encoded as the latter
   throughout this document. 
   
   A <term> is either triple of the form:

   ~<symbol> :has <string>~

   OR

   <symbol> :has <string1> <logical1> <string2> <logical2>
   ... <stringN>

   A query is

   <term1> :has <term2> [<logical1> <term3> ... <logicalN-2> <termN>]

See the reference implementation for an example of how to parse this
query language and transform it into a filter function for meta-data.
