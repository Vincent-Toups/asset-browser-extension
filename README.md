This repository contains draft documents specifying a (hopefully)
simple revision to the asset browser.

The summary is:

Each data set is associated with an meta-data object which is a list
of key/value pairs (think a JSON object) with the additional
structural constraint that the values are lists of strings or integer
numbers.

These are generated by some process (potentially automated) for each
dataset which supports the extended search functionality.

Searchers are composed of triples like:

    key :has column-value
    
And adjoined with `:or` and `:and` tokens reflecting the appropriate
logical connector.  There is some additional syntactic sugar proposed
to allow queries like:

    key :has column-value0 :and column-value1
    
to expand to:

    key :has column-value0 :and key :has column-value1
    
This would return any data set which has a key called `key` with both
values in it.

Here is a set of user stories likely to be useful:
